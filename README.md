📦 Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.13

GUI: Tkinter

Audio: winsound (Windows native)

Packaging: PyInstaller

Icon Conversion: Pillow (build-time dependency only)

The app uses a resource_path() utility to dynamically locate bundled assets (icons, images, and sound files) whether running in development or as a compiled executable.

🔒 Safety

This app runs entirely locally — it doesn’t collect or send any data.
All assets (images, sounds, icons) are packaged into the executable for a clean, portable build.
